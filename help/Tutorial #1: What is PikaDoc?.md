# What is PikaDoc?

PikaDoc is a human-readable, structured documentation format. The `pikadoc` CLI is a tool for rapidly generating and reading `pkd` doctables with advanced search features. This tutorial will go through the basics of reading and generating documentation using `pikadoc`.

`pikadoc` runs inside a `nushell` environment, giving you powerful capabilities for generating and querying documentation from a wide variety of sources. If you haven't used `nushell` before, you can learn more about it by typing `tutor`. You can then return to this tutorial by typing `doc tutor`.

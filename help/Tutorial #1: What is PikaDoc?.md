PikaDoc is a human-readable, structured documentation format. The `pikadoc` CLI is a tool for rapidly generating and reading `pkd` doctables with full text search capabilities.

`pikadoc` runs inside a `nushell` environment, giving you powerful capabilities for querying and reading documentation. If you haven't used `nushell` before, you can learn more about it by typing `tutor`. You can then return to this tutorial by typing `doc tutor`.
